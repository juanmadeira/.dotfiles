### Description
This patch adds default transparency parameters to config.h which specify the starting transparencies of all windows.

It also adds opacities to the ruleset, enabling override of the opacities on a per client basis.

Additionally, it adds some shortcuts:
```
[MODKEY]+[o]         -> increase focus opacity of currently focused window
[MODKEY]+[Shift]+[o] -> decrease focus opacity of currently focused window
```
