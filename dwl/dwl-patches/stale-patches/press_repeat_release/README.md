### Description
This patch adds 3 additional options to the `Key` struct, `on_press`, `on_repeat` and `on_release` which can be used to control which events a key binding should be triggered on.

NOTE: Due to concerns about patching difficulties this patch does NOT include any changes to `config.def.h`. After applying you will need to add the 3 additional initializers to each key binding that you would like to modify. Any key binding that is not updated will cause a build warning but should function as it does in vanilla.
