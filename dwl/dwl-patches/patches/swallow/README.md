### Description

This patch adds "window swallowing" to dwl.

If a user runs a graphical program from the terminal (e.g., `mpv`), the terminal
will be hidden and only a window of the newly spawned graphical program will
be visible. The terminal stays hidden until the graphical program is closed.
This patch helps users spawning a lot of graphical programs from their command
line by avoiding cluttering the screen with many unusable terminals.

`foot` is the terminal by default, you can change it in client rules in config.h.

In `2025-03-03 v0.7` version and above, the patch had been rewritten from
scratch to make it more robust and add a few more features:

- "dynamically swallow" windows by pressing `Alt+a` (a focused window will
  swallow/unswallow the previously focused one)
- toggle automatic swallowing by `Alt+Shift+a`
- if a window has swallowed another, it get thicker borders
