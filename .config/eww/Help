<-- Troubleshoot -->

<-- One or more of things is not showing proper value -->
Note: 
1. all scripts being use are in the scripts folder.
2. I've set everything to upate every few minutes if you want changes to take effect immediately adjust script intervals in eww.yuck file

Music:
check script "music" it controls spotify if it's running and fallsback to mpd if you're not using both then configure it in music script.

Volume:
It's using Pulseaudio to increase decrease and get value make sure you have pamixer installed. lookinto "sbvol" script for more details. you can replace pulse scripts with alsa scripts to do same thing if you're using that

Brightness: 
It's using xbacklight, replace the scripts in "sbbri" to your own to do same thing 

Battery: 
Showing battery percent of "BAT0" if your's have different name replace name in sbbat

Wifi/Ethernet:
it's showing status and name of wifi on hower using nmcli, just run nmcli in your terminal, want to check more go to script "sbwifi" 

Cpu:
it's taking value from top command. edit "cpu" script to change

Ram:
it won't show cached memory only used memory, using free -m edit "ram" script to change

Netspeed:
it's not actually speed meter, it's showing changes in download and upload data since last time script was run so if you run it every second. it should be similar to speed per second. more in netstat script

Weather: 
you need to set up api first, check out instructions in "weather" script.

profile:
replace with your pic in images/profile.png
change your name in dash/eww.yuck


<-- One of this thing is not working at all -->
Note: Everything that opens in outside window is in the script popup 

Workspace:
workspace script (scripts/workspace) works with my bspwm setup 
if you have different things in bspwmrc this won't work

Background of Dashboard:
transperancy of eww-bgblur in picom.conf
example:  
opacity-rule = [
  "30:class_g = 'eww-bgblur'" ,
];

Screenmanagement: 
changing screens will mess your wallpaper, picom, eww bar
add script to setwallpaper in (scripts/screen)

adblock:
This won't work at all without setting up.
I have script to block which takes domains from hosts (in script folder) file and puts them in /etc/hosts to block them
clicking off will remove those domains from /etc/hosts
how does this work ?
let's say you want to block facebook.com
add 0.0.0.0 facebook.com to /etc/hosts and you won't be able to open facebook. until you remove that line
I'm using hosts list from project https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts.git to block adware and porn you can make your own blocklist and replace mine
Note: you need sudo permission to makechanges in /etc/hosts 
I've added this line to sudoers for this, you need to add yourself for it to work
ALL ALL=NOPASSWD: /home/*user*/.config/eww/scripts/adblock
